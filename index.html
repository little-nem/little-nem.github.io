             <article>
                 <h1 id="h1_welcome!">Welcome!</h1>
                 <p>I am a PhD student working at the <a href="https://institutducerveau-icm.org/fr/">Paris Brain Institute</a> in the <a href="https://www.aramislab.fr/">Aramis</a> team, supervised by <a href="https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Stanley.Durrleman/">Stanley Durrleman</a>.</p>
                 <p>My work is focused on the <em>modelisation of neurodegenerative diseases</em>.
                 A question which my research revolves around is the one of <em>longitudinal subtyping</em> in heterogeneous cohorts.  In other words, I try to formalize a notion of typical subtypes in the progression of a disease and I devise methods to discover and understand them in a variety of clinical data.
                 I use rigorous statistical frameworks to assess the robustness of discovered subtypes and make sure they are of clinical relevance.  I believe that new methods blending the clinical insights of longitudinal studies with the dense information lying in high-dimensional data such as genetic or imaging data could greatly improve our knowledge about such disorders.
                 Ultimately I hope that some of those tools will find their way to clinical use and be useful for tasks such as performing early diagnosis or designing better clinical trials.</p>
                 <p>My research is guided by my skills and interests whose scope ranges from applied mathematics and computer science to contemporary medical and clinical questions.
                 Among other things, I have gathered experience in modern signal, image and shape processing methods, that involved the use of probability theory, differential geometry, optimal transport.
                 I have also faced many bio-medical contexts and I worked using data from a variety of modalities such as sEEG, structural and functional MRI, genetic data, clinical scores and bio-banks.</p>
                 <p>Here are some of the projects I partook in before starting my PhD.</p>

                             <p>I worked under the supervision of <a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/pgori/">Pietro Gori</a> at Telecom ParisTech on tractogram segmention, and atlas transfer using Optimal Transport tools. This was a joint work with Pierre Rousillon and <a href="http://www.jeanfeydy.com/">Jean Feydy</a>.</p>

                                 <p>I studied and introduced new tools for the investigation of brain connectivity networks during an internship that I did in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/empenn/">Empenn</a> team. See the <a href="studies/M2/internship/report.pdf">report</a> I wrote on this project, as part of my master degree.</p>

                                     <p>I studied the detection of High-Frequency Oscillations in electroencephalograms using modern methods in time-frequency analysis of signals.

                         <p>With a rather more fun perspective, the page
                         <a href="anecdote.html">anecdote</a> gathers some anecdotes that were generated by a
                         <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-2">gpt-2</a> model. They do not reflect any kind
                         of truth, although they can sometimes be fun to read.</p>
                         <p>I also maintain a page gathering some <a href="latex.html">LaTeX and TikZ tips</a>,
                         that is mostly intended to be a personal <strong>aide-m√©moire</strong>, but it could be
                         useful to others as well.</p>
