         <h3>Super Paul McCartney</h3>
         Paul McCartney thought he had broken numerous crazy world records, including the speed record for a human being and the longest flight over land or sea.
         
         He was also the first person to travel from the United Kingdom to New Zealand and back by submarine.
         
         But the world didn't agree. He was told by the Guinness Book that he could only be a "superhuman" because he was not really a human.
         
         He became a superhuman, and it is only in this form of existence that he could brake records.
         
         Now the world agrees he's really a superhuman, too - and this is why he is not really human.
         
         In fact, he's the same size as a human being but with a huge amount of superhuman strength.
         
         In this new form, McCartney looks like a normal, ordinary human, but there is a great deal of power within him.
         
         It's almost as big as a house.
         
         "It might well have taken an earthquake or an asteroid to knock him off this peak," Guinness World Records Editor-in-Chief, Mark Smith, told CNN's Erin Burnett.
         
         Smith has decided not to put an asterisk next to the title for "The World's Toughest Man" but he does have three words to explain the decision: "This is just an exercise for him."
         
         It's not a new thing, but Guinness World Records has decided not to put an asterisk at the title for this record because "this is just an exercise for him. But this is something I do think that we need to remember."
         
         In addition to this record, the record holder is also the longest time-traveller over land, with the longest time-travelled over sea, and the fastest human being in the world.
         
         Smith said that the record is based on "what the person does with it."
         
         "And he does have a lot to celebrate."

             Below this line are the old anecdotes that I gathered over time.
         
         <h3>Watermelon is not the key</h3>Scientist have established that it is extremely unlikely that eating watermelon can prevent you from losing your keys. In fact, scientists have concluded that eating watermelon will actually make you lose your keys. So, if you're not interested in getting your keys for sure, why not have a go at the watermelon?

         <h3>A collection of short anecdotes about Stanley Kubrick.</h3>Contrary to popular belief, Stanley Kubrick would not eat anything else than chocolate for breakfast.
         In the 1970s, Stanley took a vacation for several weeks to the Maldives. The only items allowed in his cabin was a can of tuna from Japan. During the trip, the hotel was not open to guests, so no one was allowed to eat anything except that can of tuna.
         It is said that when Stanley was writing the screenplay for 2001: A Space Odyssey, he was told not to use any words from Greek or Sanskrit since they had no proper English equivalents.
         Kubrick, a strong advocate for free speech, refused to see the film unless everyone was allowed to see it too.
         On March 20th, 1963, when Kubrick was about to open the doors of the famous MGM studio in Culver City, California, the studio was locked and the lights were turned off. Kubrick, his wife Christiane and his children were locked inside the studio and had to stay in hiding for several days. The studio was then reopened with the lights again on.
         Stanley Kubrick had a very high-pitched voice. This is most likely due to the fact that he lived in a large home in California with his wife Christiane and children.
         When asked what is the worst thing about working for Stanley Kubrick, his closest friend says that he has never seen him do anything well.
         His favorite thing to do was to watch television programs such as The Twilight Zone and Doctor Who.
         In his final moments of life, Stanley Kubrick did not want to be touched at all. He wanted to be alone in his bedroom, and for his daughter Christiane to be with him. He then asked his assistant: "Is the light on?".
         Kubrick was known to be extremely sensitive to sound. In order to get his attention, his assistants would wear headphones and put them on his nose.

         <h3>Alpacas should not cross the ocean!</h3>Here is the thing that would happen if we introduced alpacas in european cities: it would create an enormous chain reaction among the population which will lead to the total removal of all the current wild animals from european cities. This would lead to a complete loss of biodiversity and all of the wild animal species in europe would become extinct. The population of alpacas in europe will then be reduced to the levels seen today. In other words, zero. In this scenario, it would make sense not to introduce alpacas in european cities.

         <h3>Midsummer Ball in Port Pirie</h3>In Port Pirie, there is a weird annual event called the "Midsummer Ball,"
         where a whole pack of local sheep are led into the city to have a go at
         some drinking with the locals. As the sheep go around the pub, some of them
         start to get drunk. The sheep decide to take advantage and start to attack
         people in the bar. It goes on until the sheep are all inside and the people
         have no choice but to flee.

         <h3>The history of a forgotten recipe</h3>In 1934, a new recipe for a "bacon" cookie was published in the Annals of
         Improbable Research. In the recipe, you can see that the cookie is made using
         flour, sugar, cocoa, and egg yolk. You can also see that the ingredients are
         not only specified, but are labeled. It also indicates the temperature the
         cookie is to be baked at and that it is to be baked in a pan covered with
         parchment paper.
         
         The "bacon" cookies were an instant hit. A year later, a "bacon" cookie version
         was printed in the March 1935 issue of The Women's Home Companion. In the
         "bacon" cookies, you can see the instructions have been changed to indicate
         the ingredients.
         
         And in 1937, a "bacon" cookie recipe appeared in a cookbook called Bakes and
         Cookies that was published by the same publisher as the one that published
         Annals of Improbable Research. They use the same flour, sugar, cocoa, and
         egg yolks that was used in the "bacon" cookie recipe.

         <h3>Koalas can be agressive</h3>A koala was caught on video this week in Melbourne, Australia, trying to
         fight a dog named Doxie. Doxie, an Alaskan Malamute-shepherd mix, was being
         watched by a group of people in a park when the koala jumped in front of her,
         the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She then began fighting the dog, and
         the group of onlookers called for help. When police arrived on the scene,
         the koala got away in a nearby bush. The video shows the animal running
         toward the park, as onlookers scream at her to "get the f--- out!"

         <h3>High ELO Rats</h3>There is a famous chess match in which players physically lost several pieces in the middle of the game. They were nowhere to be found. The preferred hypothesis is that they had escaped.
         
         This is one of those ideas that seems to make sense but doesn't. But it has been confirmed.
         
         In 2011, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley found that chess-playing rats had actually been trained to find their own chess pieces. And they managed to train these rats to find them. The researchers trained these rats to find the chess pieces by giving them a reward when they found a chess piece and a punishment if they did not find the chess piece and instead ate a marshmallow.

         <h3>A fuel-powered vice-president</h3>
         Colombia's vice-president for sure loves cars: in only one week, he bought
         some of his favourite sports car and drove it around to the supermarket in an
         attempt to get a discount, before buying himself the next one. That's right:
         he paid for the car by doing a drive in it.
         
         And, yes: he did it only to save a few pesos.
         
         According to the newspaper El Pais, Mr Bustarreta bought the car after a
         friend offered him a discount, which, by the way, was a lot of savings if
         you had the discount obtained after driving around the supermarket.

         <h3>A long lasting animal breed</h3>The scientist and philosopher René Descartes had a very peculiar theory
         about turtles: that they had the capacity to change themselves into other
         animals, but not into plants.
         
         This is not quite true, at least by natural selection. There are many ways of
         changing yourself into another species: by interbreeding, by hybridization,
         through mutation, by hybridization with plants, by hybridization with animals,
         and so on. There is no one way of turning into another species.

         <h3>This game will turn any place into a zoo!</h3>There is a fun game involving animals, called "Animal Monopoly."
         
         This is a game that a couple of friends and me played in New York, where we
         played it with a group of people in our class. The objective is to have as
         many animals as possible. It's a fairly easy game and it's also quite amusing.
         
         The rule is simple. The game is over when you have as many animals as you
         can at a given location:
         
         So if you want to keep trying to be more like the cats, the best way to
         do it is to make sure that you are at the zoo (as the cats are, at least,
         the only ones with an apartment). You can get as many animals as you can,
         by taking turns taking animals from your box.
         
         Once you have the animals you can place them anywhere on your piece. You
         don't have to do the exact placement, but you have to go to a location and
         find the location that has enough animals already.

         <h3>The Pope's friend</h3>The Pope's favourite pet is a giant panda named Pookie who travels with the
         Pope during the annual Christmas tour of Asia, said to be the most important
         event in his life.
         
         Mr Bajos said Pookie has become the Pope's 'best friend' and the animals
         have been allowed to stay in his home.
         
         'I am sure that he loves this big panda. He can go and stay at my house and
         he is really happy about it,' he added.

         <h3>Donald Trump is at ease with his passion for golf</h3>
         Here is an excerpt of the upcomming Donald Trump's book, dealing about his
         passion for golf and golf courses and how he has spent more of his life on
         the course than with his family:
         
         "I've gotten so good at it I don't even need my wife. My life is like a
         big game of golf. I win, I win, I win. I get very good. When I started,
         I was really bad. I got really good over the years. I'm really good. I love
         golf so much. It's so much fun. My wife can't even get in the car with me,
         it's like I don't even know what she's doing and I'm just sitting right
         there." "I love golf and I love to play. I love it as much as anything. I'm
         not much for the actual competition, but I don't care because I win. I love
         winning. But there's no room for error."

         <h3>Communism advices</h3>
         Here are some wise advices to remember in case you are a card carrying member
         of the communist party:
         
         1. "When a man takes his meals at a communist restaurant his thoughts are with
         the revolution and he never returns to the bourgeois restaurants." (Communist
         Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels "The workers' commissariat
         must always be on the alert for new means to increase efficiency of
         production." (Communist Manifesto)
         
         2. "The best way to control a crowd is to keep it on its feet." (Communist
         Manifesto)
          "In the communist society there will be no longer any bourgeoisie, there
          will be only the communist proletariat." (Communist Manifesto)
         
         3. "The most effective method of making a crowd of people do as you want them
         to will be to make them think they are doing as you want them to." (Communist
         Manifesto)
         
         4. "The first step in getting a crowd to do something, is to make them
         believe it is necessary to do it." (Communist Manifesto)
         
         5. "Communism does not abolish classes, rather it creates an entirely new
         social order in which they have to disappear." (Communist Manifesto)
         
         6. "The only answer to the proletariat is direct action, and its weapon is
         the factory." (Communist Manifesto)
         
         7. "In the beginning the struggle against the machine was only a struggle for
         bread, but now, thanks to Marxism, it is a fight for life itself." (Communist

         <h3>The White House Dolphin</h3>
         Barack Obama once declared that he saw a dolphin swimming in the sea with a
         human on its back. He also stated that he was the one who made the dolphin
         swim by giving it a push.
         
         The Obama White House claimed they gave the dolphin a push.
         
         On November 4 the White House sent out a tweet saying this dolphin is alive
         and well with a human on its back in a swimming pool:
         
         "The @WhiteHouse can confirm that Barack and Michelle Obama saw this dolphin
         at the @RaulLago pool today. We gave it a push."
         
         In a tweet dated November 3, 2013 , White House staff told followers that
         the "Obama's Dolphin did not swim today: "Our @WhiteHouse Dolphin is fine. But
         he does not swim today."
         
         "He does not swim today" is a lie from Barack Obama. The White House is a
         hoax to cover up Obama's crimes against the American people. "This one time,
         in a swimming pool" is Obama's lies on the internet.  In a recent tweet from
         November 2, 2013 , Donald Trump said this: "@WhiteHouse this is what I saw in
         the @RaulLagos pool today when I met this beautiful dolphin" And he has been
         saying such things all year: "I am not a dolphin expert, but I do know what
         I saw in the Raul Lagos pool on Sunday when I met this beautiful dolphin".
         
         So what is this dolphin and why did Donald Trump say this?

         <h3>T-Rexes were actually quite easy to escape from</h3>According to a recent study, a T-Rex is physically not able to jump over
         the Great Wall of China, because the Great Wall is too big. In a sense,
         the Great Wall is too high.
         
         A large-sized and tall obstacle can actually block the T-Rex's movement in one
         direction, which means the T-Rex cannot turn around and run in that direction.
         
         The researchers suggested that this may have been the reason why the T-Rex
         was incapable of going into the water. This is what scientists found on a
         recent expedition to China's famous Yangtze River.
         
         They found that an enormous and tall wall of stone blocks had blocked the
         T-Rex's pathway.
         
         As a result, the scientists suggest that the T-Rex was unable to jump over
         the huge wall, hence the reason why it was unable to go into the water.
         
         The findings were based on a study conducted in 2011.
         
         "Although the size of this barrier can be compared with the Great Wall
         of China, the T-Rex's body has a high level of muscle power and was not
         physically able to break the wall as a result of its massive muscles, it is
         still a high level of body strength to withstand the pressure of the wall,"
         said a study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
         
         The researchers also found that a wall at this height can block the T-Rex's
         movements in a direction of only a quarter circle around the obstacle -
         a much smaller area than the width of the Great Wall itself.
         
         "This obstacle blocks the way of the T-Rex's body to reach the ocean,"
         the scientists wrote.

         <h3>The right to change names!</h3>The true names of Santa Claus deers are in the process of changing, according
         to a news report by CBS affiliate KHOU.
         
         A new study conducted on about 300 white-tailed deer in Oklahoma revealed
         that the creatures' true name is actually "Rudolph."
         
         KHOU obtained the information from the state's Department of Wildlife's
         Wildlife Resource Specialist.
         
         "There was a name change done a month ago for Rudolph and it was in the
         paper about a week or so ago — we just found out about this today," said
         the spokesperson.  The deer named "Rudolph," which is the traditional name
         used for the deer, could get a new name for its species.
         
         "We don't know what the name of the next deer will be," said spokesman Bob
         Haines. "We'll probably get a name and put a little plaque on it to show it
         was the one named Rudolph."
         
         Rudolph is a name that has been in use for white-tailed deer since at least
         the 1960s.  There is also a chance that this year's name could be changed.
         
         In the past the name has changed from "Rudolph" to "Horse."  "We'll change it
         to whatever we want to do," said Haines. "But we'll probably still put a plaque
         on it."  According to the state, the white-tailed deer's true name is "Rupy."
         
         The study will also look at the species' geographic distribution.
         
         "We will take a look at some of the numbers and numbers of each of those groups
         so we can have an idea of where they're all at, but then we might get some
         of the deer that are actually in the state or around the state to determine
         their locations," said Haines.  As the new name is considered, the state
         will be looking at the potential for changing the species' official color,
         according to the spokesperson.  This is the first time that deer with the
         name "Rudolph" have been observed outside of Oklahoma, the spokesman said.
         In addition to the official name change, the report found that white-tailed
         deer that are not named Rudolph are "Mosepw" and "Cox," respectively.
         The research is expected to be complete by the end of August.

         <h3>A weird football match</h3>The weirdest football match ever took place in a church. A team of
         two-year-olds, each named 'Lazy Lizzie' – Lazy for lazy, Lizzie for lazy,
         but mostly Lizzie because they're named after the best singer ever – took
         on a team of 10 year-olds, all named 'Slyly Lizzie'.
         
         In the first round, they lost and went down to the next round as a result. In
         the second, they scored.
         
         Then, in the third round, they won! This match was one of the biggest and
         greatest ever to take place at a church.

         <h3>Motorboating on a Nestle product... not so sure!</h3>There is motorboat brand that is owned by Nestlé. The giant agri-food corporation chose to buy a motorboat brand because the brand was so popular and they felt the boat brand would provide a good marketing platform to drive sales with the potential for growth.
         
         The motor boat brand is named after the founder of the company. He was a pioneer who believed in the power of the motorboat and in the value of the brand as a marketing tool.
         
         So, why are we talking about the Nestlé boat brand?
         
         The company is currently in court fighting lawsuits filed against it by a handful of consumers and the company, the motorboat brand, is one of the plaintiffs in that lawsuit.
         
         The lawsuits seek compensation and redress for consumers who purchased motorboats from the Nestlé boat brand and for the company for the damages it suffered for failing to deliver the promised products.
         
         The company says that it has never made and is not currently manufacturing and selling motorboats, but it is being sued for failing to deliver products, the Nestlé brand being the name of the company and for breaching the contract signed by consumers.
         
         In this regard, the company says that it has a legal obligation and responsibility to fulfill the promise and deliver the product that is represented.
         This legal battle is being fought as part of a broader battle of the brands . This brand war includes a number of different companies that sell the same products.

         <h3>A useful tip in case of a tropical fight</h3>During a fight involving a tiger, a gorilla and an angry elephant, the
         best strategy is to hit the elephant first. The gorilla, however, is a very
         fast-moving predator. This is a dangerous position for an elephant to be in,
         and the gorilla, who is a larger and larger elephant, is a very dangerous
         opponent. The best strategy is to hit the gorilla first, and then try to hit
         the elephant. When the gorilla hits the elephant, the elephant is no longer an
         elephant, it is now a gorilla. And that means that the gorilla is no longer a
         threat to the elephant. This is a really good strategy. If the gorilla hits
         the elephant, it will not only kill the elephant outright, but it will kill
         any other large animals that are nearby that might be in immediate danger
         from it. So, if you can get the gorilla to go first, you can get them to stop
         attacking and leave you to continue killing the elephants. If you can get
         the gorilla to go first, the tiger will not stop attacking and attacking,
         leaving you with no choice but to go with the gorilla and kill the elephant.
         
         There are a couple reasons why this strategy may not work. First, the gorilla
         can be very dangerous at times and will be more likely to strike before
         the elephant. And second, sometimes elephants will be more dangerous than
         gorillas. And so, sometimes the best strategy is to go with the gorilla
         and not the elephant. So, in the example, if a gorilla hits the elephant
         immediately, the elephant is no longer an elephant, and so the gorilla is no
         longer a threat. That, however, is not the situation that I want to discuss,
         because I want to make the gorilla the most dangerous.

         <h3>The original plot for Baby Driver leaked</h3>The original plot for Baby Driver was the following: Baby is a getaway
         driver in Atlanta. Baby ferries crews of robbers assembled by Doc, a criminal
         mastermind. Between jobs, he remixes snippets of recorded conversations and
         tapes for new stories. Doc makes a fortune from these. He's the one who makes
         sure Baby doesn't get caught. When Baby is arrested for his latest job, he
         is offered a chance to do it over, which he decides he can't pass up. He is
         released, and Baby starts a new life. His name is Baby Driver.  In the movie,
         this all seems simple: Baby takes jobs and is arrested for them. But in the
         real world, it's not that simple.  What's the actual reason for Baby's arrest?
         Well, when the cops get to Baby in the movie, he's driving a fancy Ferrari
         and is dressed very stylishly. It's the same car Doc uses, and they both
         look the same. In the movie, Baby is arrested on suspicion of drug use, but
         in real life, the cops didn't even find drugs in his car.  Baby Driver also
         uses this trope. Baby is arrested for speeding. But real life police only
         have reason to pull him over because he's driving at such a high speed he's
         not visible to the oncoming traffic. So he's caught by the cops, but they've
         had no reason to think he's a bad guy in the first place. Baby is also given
         no reason to fear them because he doesn't have any money on him, and they
         can't confiscate that.  And then there are the scenes with Baby's girlfriend,
         who isn't Baby's girlfriend in the film, but has been in the script.

         <h3>Napolean was concerned about the bear-hazard</h3>Napoleon might have said once that any bear could kill a human being, a bear
         could kill a tiger, and a tiger could kill a bear. He may have meant it as
         a joke, but when we turn to his words and consider the evidence, we find
         the same joke in them and in his life.
         
         The first time in history that a bear was seen killing a human being is in the
         early part of the eighteenth century. The first known bear attack occurred
         on October 9, 1680 when two men were attacked by a bear on the road between
         Bratislava and Szczecin (now Koper). The first recorded recorded attack
         that occurred after the first known bear attack was on April 25, 1681 near
         Miskolc (now Szczecin). In the years that followed, several attacks were
         recorded in Poland and Hungary (a few times in the former) and in Hungary
         the only recorded attack occurred on June 25, 1706 in a forest near Koper
         (then the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary).

         <h3>Wales scientist are back at it again</h3>There are scientists in Wales studying how long a monkey can go without a human
         presence without it becoming depressed. There are others researching whether
         the same can be said for a chimpanzee. In the end, it may be that a species
         can learn to cope if they are left unattended by a human for long periods of
         time, but the reality is that some species are just less capable of learning.
         
         There is, however, one species that I believe has been successfully left
         alone for extended periods of time. The black rhinoceros, an animal with
         a large brain size, a big heart and a strong ability to survive in harsh
         terrain, was thought to be one such species until scientists discovered that
         it would not learn to adapt to the harsh climate conditions of the African
         plains unless a human presence was nearby.

         <h3>Working for and against the bad guys</h3>There was an inventor working for the Mafia during prohibition called
         James J. "Jimmy" Doyle. Doyle invented a device to detect alcohol content
         by using the smell of alcohol. As a consequence, his invention was used to
         convict people of alcohol crimes, and he was given the nickname "The Alcohol
         Doctor". In the early 1950s, the Alcohol Industry Association (the American
         alcohol industry group) began to support the concept of "alcohol detection
         devices" in the United States, and soon the term "alcohol detection devices"
         began to become accepted to refer to the most common alcohol detection devices
         available to the public. These devices are used in the United States to
         detect and measure alcohol content in a beverage. In the United Kingdom they
         are called "alcohol level" devices. The devices are generally calibrated and
         then "dumped" onto the beverage, which will give the amount of alcohol that is
         present in the beverage. When these devices "work", they are called "detectors"
         or "detectors" - which are generally "detectors" that are not calibrated.

         <h3>The long story of the American nuclear codes</h3>The Gold Codes (the launch codes for nuclear weapons provided to the Presidents
         of the United States) were originally created by the British, but since the
         British gave them to the Americans, they became the American Presidents' codes.
         
         
         After the American nuclear bombs went off at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there
         was a worldwide scramble for the codes. The codes were given to the American
         Presidents in a brief ceremony in the White House (where they were held),
         then the codes were delivered to the US Secretary of State.
         
         When the codes were delivered, the Secretary of State turned them over to the
         American Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence. (The
         code for the ICBM launch codes, the SSO code which was used in the nuclear
         missile launch codes in the Soviet Union, was given to the Soviets in the
         Soviet Union in the same manner as the American codes were given to the
         Americans.) The Americans then handed them over to the Commander of the US
         Strategic Air Command, who passed them over to the Commander of US Strategic
         Missile Command, who passed them over to the Director of the US Missile
         Defense Organization, who passed them over to the Director of the US Air
         Defense Command, who passed them over to the Commander of the US Pacific Air
         Defense Command, who passed them on to the Commanders of the US European Air
         Defense Command, who passed them on to the Air Force Command, which passed
         them to the Commander of the US Army Strategic Command, which passed them
         on to the Commander of the US Army Strategic Missile Command, which passed
         them on to the Commander of the US Army Strategic Nuclear Command, which
         passed them over to the Commander of the US Strategic Command. These codes
         were used to launch the nuclear missiles at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

         <h3>Free the Kangaroos!</h3>Is had been found that Australia is not an island anymore but is rather
         some kind of kangaroo zoo! There is no need for a "tour of karoo," because
         the kangarsoo have been captured and are now in captivity. They are fed a
         diet of carrots, potatoes, and beans, and are constantly encouraged to move
         from their home to the other side of the island to reach the sea. This is
         a very dangerous task, because if they make it to shore, there's a good
         chance they'll fall into the water, where they'll be eaten by the sharks
         (the kangaroos are very intelligent, and if they fall into the water,
         their only chance of survival is to escape and swim away to land). But
         the kangarsoo are eager to be free to live in their own country again,
         because it's their country, and they have a home there. It is also a good
         opportunity for the kangaroos to practice their language again, for they
         can now speak with each other and they can communicate directly with the
         kangarsoo that have also made landfall as "free people". In other words,
         it's an opportunity to practice the English language, and in this country,
         the kangaroos can speak and read English.

         He is one of thousands of people who have used the ancient technique of
         "pole-dancing", which combines a pole with a flag, to walk from point A to
         point B, from east to west, all on foot.
         
         Most of the walkers carry a wooden stick, called a "pole", which they swing
         over their shoulder. Others hold a large "flag", called a "bouillon", on
         which they place a small white stick with the name of their destination -
         in this case, "Vladivostok".
         
         "The poles are quite heavy for a woman with a baby, and the flag is quite
         tiny," the man, named only as Sergei, told Reuters.
         
         "The pole dance itself is quite difficult," he explained, "but the flag
         and the stick are a bit easier. But if you are carrying a baby, it is
         harder."

         because the cyclist was not making a fair and decisive overtaking manoeuvre,
         but simply because the bike traffic on the road was swerving in the opposite
         direction to the cyclist, he had to make way for it. More often than not, the
         young male cyclist got his helmet swatted by a passing car, and that was that.
